# mouse-event-recorder

Mouse event recorder & play with shortcut keys. 
I prepared this script with just 2 open-source libraries, ***mouse*** and ***keyboard***. It is safety to record events & actions.
Project supports event playback speed increase/decrease options as well as you can stop/start whatever you want
Project includes that already has been built an **.exe** file in [release](https://github.com/egemengulpinar/mouse-event-recorder/releases/download/main_v1/Mouse.Event.Recorder.zip) to use this script with terminal.
